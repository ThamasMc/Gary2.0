# GARYBOT.rb

## Description
Gary is a discord bot that is capable of a couple of functions.

At the moment that includes and is limited to:
1. Announcing its identity in increasing levels of severity.
2. Resetting its current level of identity intensity.
3. Querying a 5th edition DnD API Library of Spells on Command.
  - Gary also offers suggestions on possible alternative Spells, if an exact answer is not found.

Gary lived previously in another [incarnation](https://github.com/ThamasMc/Gary) - but - as the API Gary is built upon has gone over several breaking changes since I had last taken a look at it, I figured that it would be easier to rebuild him from scratch rather than piecing him back together in Python, which I rarely use on the regular.
